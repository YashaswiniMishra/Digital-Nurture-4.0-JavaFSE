### 1. Understand Recursive Algorithms:

**Q: Explain the concept of recursion and how it can simplify certain problems.**
**A:**
Recursion is when a function calls itself to solve a problem.
It breaks complex problems into smaller sub-problems. This makes the logic clean, easy, and simplifies the difficulty of the problem.

**Example:**
Opening boxes â€“ Imagine you have a box, inside it another, and so on.
You keep opening the outer boxes until you reach the smallest inner box.

* Opening = breaking down the problem
* Innermost box = base case

### 4. Analysis:

**Q: Discuss the time complexity of your recursive algorithm.**
**A:**
**Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
Each year requires one recursive call, so total time grows linearly with `n`

**Optimization:**
We can convert to **iteration** to avoid repeatation
