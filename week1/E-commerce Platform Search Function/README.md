## Aysmptotic Notation:

### 1. Explain Big O notation and how it helps in analyzing algorithms.
-> Big O notation: 
   - It defines how fast or slow algorithm takes to run as input size grows
   - If given more data then it helps in comparing different algorithm

### 2. Describe the best, average, and worst-case scenarios for search operations.

-> For Linear Search:-
   - Best case: O(1) for first item
   Average case: O(n)
   Worst case: O(n)

   - For Binary Search:-
   Best case: O(1) for middle item
   Average case: O(log n)
   Worst case: O(log n)

### 4.	Analysis:
##### o	Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search algorithms.

##### o	Discuss which algorithm is more suitable for your platform and why.

 ->  For small lists, linear search is simple and works fine, but for faster results on big sorted data like in e-commerceâ€”binary search is the best fit.
