## Q. What is the Difference Between JPA, Hibernate, and Spring Data JPA?

A. Understanding the relationship between JPA, Hibernate, and Spring Data JPA can be confusing at first ‚Äî here's a simplified explanation:

### üîπ JPA (Java Persistence API)
- Just a **specification** (a set of rules) for working with relational databases in Java.
- Doesn't do anything on its own ‚Äî needs a tool like Hibernate to function.
- Think of it as a **contract**.

‚û°Ô∏è Example: Interfaces like `EntityManager`, annotations like `@Entity`, `@Table`.

### üîπ Hibernate
- A **concrete implementation** of JPA ‚Äî the actual tool that does the work.
- Also provides extra features beyond JPA.
- Think of it as the **worker** that follows the JPA contract.

‚û°Ô∏è Used for configuring database operations in code.

### üîπ Spring Data JPA
- A **Spring Framework** project that simplifies JPA and Hibernate.
- Removes boilerplate code ‚Äî lets you create repositories without writing SQL.
- Think of it as a **smart assistant** that handles JPA + Hibernate smoothly.

‚û°Ô∏è You define a repository interface, and Spring handles the rest.
